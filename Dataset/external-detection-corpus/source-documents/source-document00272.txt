THE MIRROR OF LITERATURE, AMUSEMENT, AND INSTRUCTION.

VOL. XIV, NO. 407.] DECEMBER 24, 1829. [PRICE 2d. XIV.

My Public--that is, our readers--we have served you seven years, through fourteen volumes;
in each renewing our professions of gratitude, and study for your gratification; and we hope
we shall not presume on your liberal disposition by calculating on your continued patronage.
We have endeavoured to keep our engagements with you--to the letter[1]--as they say in weightier
matters; and, as every man is bound to speak of the fair as he has found his market in it,
we ought to acknowledge the superabundant and quick succession of literary novelties for the
present volume. There is little of our own; because we have uniformly taken Dr. Johnson's advice
in life--"to play for much, and stake little" This will extenuate our assuming that "from castle
to cottage we are regularly taken in:" indeed, it would be worse than vanity to suppose that
price or humble pretensions should exclude us; it would be against the very economy of life
to imagine this; and we are still willing to abide by such chances of success.

    [1] This is not intended exclusively for the new type of the
        present volume.

Cheap Books, we hope, will never be an evil; for, as "the same care and toil that raise a dish
of peas at Christmas, would give bread to a whole family during six months;" so the expense
of a gay volume at this season will furnish a moderate circle with amusive reading for a twelvemonth.
We do not draw this comparison invidiously, but merely to illustrate the advantages of literary
economy.

The number Seven--the favourite of Swift, (and how could it be otherwise than odd?) has, perhaps,
led us into this rambling monologue on our merits; but we agree with Yorick in thinking gravity
an errant scoundrel.

A proportionate Index will guide our accustomed readers to any particular article in the present
volume; but for those of shorter acquaintance, a slight reference to its principal points may
be useful. Besides, a few of its delights may have been choked by weeds and crosses, and their
recollection lost amidst the lights and shadows of busy life.

The zeal of our Correspondents is first entitled to honourable mention; and many of their contributions
to these pages must have cost them much time and research; for which we beg them to accept
our best thanks.

Of the Selections, generally, we shall only observe, that our aim has been to convey information
and improvement in the most amusing form. In this way we find many good things, and banish
the rest; we attempt to "boke something new," and revive others. Thus we have described the
Siamese Twins in a single number; and in others we have brought to light many almost forgotten
antiquarian rarities.

Of Engravings, Paper, and Print, we need say but little: each speaks primâ facie, for itself.
Improvement has been studied in all of them; and in the Cuts, both interest and execution have
been cardinal points. Milan Cathedral; Old Tunbridge Wells and its Old Visitors; Clifton; Gurney's
Steam Carriage; and the Bologna Towers; are perhaps the best specimens: and by way of varying
architectural embellishments, a few of the Wonders of Nature have been occasionally introduced.

Owen Feltham would call this "a cart-rope" Preface: therefore, with promises of future exertion,
we hope our next Seven Years may be as successful as the past.

MEMOIR OF THOMAS CAMPBELL, ESQ.

Of the subject of this memoir, it has been remarked, "that he has not, that we know of, written
one line, which, dying, he could wish to blot." These few words will better illustrate the
fitness of Mr. Campbell's portrait for our volume, than a laudatory memoir of many pages. He
has not inaptly been styled the Tyrtaeus of modern English poetry, and one of the most chaste
and tender as well as original of poets. He owes less than any other British poet to his predecessors
and contemporaries. He has lived to see his lines quoted like those of earlier poets in the
literature of his day, lisped by children, and sung at public festivals. The war-odes of Campbell
have scarcely anything to match them in-the English language for energy and fire, while their
condensation and the felicitous selection of their versification are in remarkable harmony.
Campbell, in allusion to Cymon, has been said to have "conquered both on land and sea," from
his Naval Odes and "Hohenlinden" embracing both scenes of warfare.

Scotland gave birth to Thomas Campbell. He is the son of a second marriage, and was born at
Glasgow, in 1777. His father was born in 1710, and was consequently nearly seventy years of
age when the poet, his son, was ushered into the world. He was sent early to school, in his
native place, and his instructor was Dr. David Alison, a man of great celebrity in the practice
of education. He had a method of instruction in the classics purely his own, by which he taught
with great facility, and at the same time rejected all harsh discipline, substituting kindness
for terror, and alluring rather than compelling the pupil to his duty. Campbell began to write
verse when young; and some of his earliest attempts at poetry are yet extant among his friends
in Scotland. For his place of education he had a great respect, as well as for the memory of
his masters, of whom he always spoke in terms of great affection. He was twelve years old when
he quitted school for the University of Glasgow. There he was considered an excellent Latin
scholar, and gained high honour by a contest with a candidate twice as old as himself, by which
he obtained a bursary. He constantly bore away the prizes, and every fresh success only seemed
to stimulate him to more ambitious exertions. In Greek he was considered the foremost student
of his age; and some of his translations are said to be superior to any before offered for
competition in the University. While there he made poetical paraphrases of the most celebrated
Greek poets; of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Aristophanes, which were thought efforts of extraordinary
promise. Dr. Millar at that time gave philosophical lectures in Glasgow. He was a highly gifted
teacher, and excellent man. His lectures attracted the attention of young Campbell, who became
his pupil, and studied with eagerness the principles of sound philosophy; the poet was favoured
with the confidence of his teacher, and partook much of his society.

Campbell quitted Glasgow to remove into Argyleshire, where a situation in a family of some
note was offered and accepted by him. It was in Argyleshire,[2] among the romantic mountains
of the north, that his poetical spirit increased, and the charms of verse took entire possession
of his mind. Many persons now alive remember him wandering there alone by the torrent, or over
the rugged heights of that wild country, reciting the strains of other poets aloud, or silently
composing his own. Several of his pieces which he has rejected in his collected works, are
handed about in manuscript in Scotland. We quote one of these wild compositions which has hitherto
appeared only in periodical publications.

DIRGE OF WALLACE.

  They lighted a taper at the dead of night,
    And chanted their holiest hymn;
  But her brow and her bosom were damp with affright
    Her eye was all sleepless and dim!
  And the lady of Elderslie wept for her lord,
    When a death-watch beat in her lonely room,
  When her curtain had shook of its own accord;
    And the raven had flapp'd at her window-board,
  To tell of her warrior's doom!
  For night-mare rides on my strangled sleep:
    The lord of my bosom is doomed to die:
  His valorous heart they have wounded deep;
  And the blood-red tears shall his country weep,
    For Wallace of Elderslie!

  Yet knew not his country that ominous hour,
    Ere the loud matin bell was rung,
  That a trumpet of death on an English tower
    Had the dirge of her champion sung!
  When his dungeon light look'd dim and red
    On the high-born blood of a martyr slain,
  No anthem was sung at his holy death-bed;
  No weeping was there when his bosom bled--
    And his heart was rent in twain!

  Oh, it was not thus when his oaken spear
    Was true to that knight forlorn;
  And the hosts of a thousand were scatter'd like deer,
    At the blast of the hunter's horn;
  When he strode on the wreck of each well-fought field
    With the yellow-hair'd chiefs of his native land;
  For his lance was not shiver'd on helmet or shield--
  And the sword that seem'd fit for Archangel to wield,
    Was light in his terrible hand!

  Yet bleeding and bound, though her Wallace wight
    For his long-lov'd country die,
  The bugle ne'er sung to a braver knight
    Than Wallace of Elderslie!
  But the day of his glory shall never depart,
    His head unentomb'd shall with glory be balm'd,
  From its blood-streaming altar his spirit shall start;
  Though the raven has fed on his mouldering heart,
    A nobler was never embalm'd!

From Argyleshire, where his residence was not a protracted one, Campbell removed to Edinburgh.
There he soon became introduced to some of the first men of the age, whose friendship and kindness
could not fail to stimulate a mind like that of Campbell. He became intimate with the late
Dugald Stewart; and almost every other leading professor of the University of Edinburgh was
his friend. While in Edinburgh, he brought out his celebrated "Pleasures of Hope," at the age
of twenty-one. It is perhaps not too much to say of this work, that no poet of this country
ever produced, at so early an age, a more elaborate and finished performance. For this work,
which for twenty years produced the publishers between two and three hundred pounds a year,
the author received at first but £10, which was afterwards increased by an additional sum,
and by the profits of a quarto edition of the work. By a subsequent act of the legislature,
extending the term of copyright, it reverted again to the author; but with no proportional
increase of profit. Campbell's pecuniary circumstances are said to have been by no means easy
at this time and a pleasant anecdote is recorded of him, in allusion to the hardships of an
author's case, somewhat similar to his own: he was desired to give a toast at a festive moment
when the character of Napoleon was at its utmost point of disesteem in England. He gave "Bonaparte."
The company started with astonishment. "Gentlemen," said he, "here is Bonaparte in his character
of executioner of the booksellers." Palm, the bookseller, had just been executed in Germany,
by the orders of the French.

After residing nearly three years in Edinburgh, Campbell quitted his native country for the
Continent. He sailed for Hamburgh, and there made many acquaintances among the more enlightened
circles, both of that city and Altona. At that time there were numerous Irish exiles in the
neighbourhood of Hamburgh, and some of them fell in the way of the poet, who afterwards related
many curious anecdotes of them. There were sincere and honest men among them, who, with the
energy of their national character, and enthusiasm for liberty, had plunged into the desperate
cause of the rebellion two years before, and did not, even then, despair of freedom and equality
in Ireland. Some of them were in private life most amiable persons, and their fate was altogether
entitled to sympathy. The poet, from that compassionate feeling which is an amiable characteristic
of his nature, wrote The Exile of Erin, from the impression their situation and circumstances
made upon his mind. It was set to an old Irish air, of the most touching pathos, and will perish
only with the language.

Campbell travelled over a great part of Germany and Prussia--visiting the Universities, and
storing his mind with German literature. From the walls of a convent he commanded a view of
part of the field of Hohenlinden during that sanguinary contest, and proceeded afterwards in
the track of Moreau's army over the scene of combat. This impressive sight produced the Battle
of Hohenlinden--an ode which is as original as it is spirited, and stands by itself in British
literature. The poet tells a story of the phlegm of a German postilion at this time, who was
driving him post by a place where a skirmish of cavalry had happened, and who alighted and
disappeared, leaving the carriage and the traveller alone in the cold (for the ground was covered
with snow) for a considerable space of time. At length he came back; and it was found that
he had been employing himself in cutting off the long tails of the slain horses, which he coolly
placed on the vehicle, and drove on his route. Campbell was also in Ratisbon when the French
and Austrian treaty saved it from bombardment.

In Germany Campbell made the friendship of the two Schlegels, of many of the first literary
and political characters, and was fortunate enough to pass an entire day with the venerable
Klopstock, who died just two years afterwards. The proficiency of Campbell in the German language
was rendered very considerable by this tour, and his own indefatigable perseverance in study.
His travels in Germany occupied him thirteen months; when he returned to England, and, for
the first time, visited London. He soon afterwards composed those two noble marine odes, The
Battle of the Baltic, and Ye Mariners of England, which, with his Hohenlinden, stand unrivalled
in the English tongue; and though, as Byron lamented, Campbell has written so little, these
odes alone are enough to place him unforgotten in the shrine of the Muses.

In 1803 the poet married Miss Sinclair, a lady of Scottish descent, and considerable personal
beauty, but of whom he was deprived by death in 1828. He resided at Sydenham, and the entire
neighbourhood of that pleasant village reckoned itself in the circle of his friends; nor did
he quit his suburban retreat until, in 1821, literary pursuits demanded his residence in the
metropolis. It was at Sydenham, in a house nearly facing the reservoir, that the poet produced
his greatest work, Gertrude of Wyoming, written in the Spenserian stanza. About the same time
Campbell was appointed Professor of Poetry in the Royal Institution, where he delivered lectures
which have since been published. He also undertook the editorship of Selections from the British
Poets, intended as specimens of each, and accompanied with critical remarks.[3]

    [3] This work is in seven handsome library volumes; a new edition
        was announced two or three years since, but has not yet
        appeared.

Soon after the publication of his "Specimens," he revisited Germany, and passed some time in
Vienna, where he acquired a considerable knowledge of the Austrian court and its manners. He
remained long at Bonn, where his friend, W.A. Schlegel, resides. Campbell returned to England
in 1820, to undertake the editorship of the New Monthly Magazine, and coupled with his name,
it has risen to a very extensive circulation. In 1824, Campbell published his "Theodric, a
Domestic Tale," the least popular of his works.

By his marriage Campbell had two sons. One of them died before attaining his twentieth year;
the other, while in the University of Bonn, where he was placed for his education, exhibited
symptoms of an erring mind, which, on his return to England soon afterwards, ripened into mental
derangement of the milder species. After several years passed in this way, during which the
mental disease considerably relaxed, so that young Campbell became wholly inoffensive, and
his father received him into his house. The effect of this upon a mind of the most exquisite
sensibility like the poet's, may be readily imagined: it was, at times, a source of the keenest
suffering.

We must now allude to an event in Campbell's life, which will ensure him the gratitude of ages
to come: we mean as the originator of the London University. Four years before it was made
public, the idea occurred to him, from his habit of visiting the Universities of Germany, and
studying their regulations. He communicated it at first to two or three friends, until his
ideas upon the subject became matured, when they were made public, and a meeting upon the business
convened in London, which Mr. Campbell addressed, and where the establishment of such an institution
met the most zealous support. Once in operation, several public men of high talent, headed
by Mr. Brougham, lost not a moment in forwarding the great and useful object in view. The undertaking
was divided into shares, which were rapidly taken; but Mr. Campbell left the active arrangements
to others, and contented himself with attending the committees. With unexampled rapidity the
London University has been completed, or nearly so, and Campbell has had the satisfaction of
seeing his projected instrument of education almost in full operation in less than three years
after he made the scheme public. Although one of the most important,[4] this is not the only
public-spirited event of this description, in Mr. Campbell's life; for he was instrumental
in the establishment of the Western Literary Institution, in Leicester Square; and at the present
time he is, we believe, in conjunction with other eminent literary men, organizing a club to
be entitled the Literary Union, whose lists already contain upwards of 300 men of talent, including
Sir Walter Scott and all the principal periodical writers of the day.

    [4] Still, Mr. Campbell's name does not occur in the List of Council
        or Professors of the University, in the British Almanac for the
        present year.

Campbell, as has already been observed, was educated at Glasgow, and received the honour of
election as Lord Rector, three successive years, notwithstanding the opposition of the professors,
and the excellent individuals who were placed against him; among whom were the late minister
Canning, and Sir Walter Scott. The students of Glasgow College considered that the celebrity
of the poet, his liberal principles, his being a fellow-townsman, and his attention to their
interests, entitled him to the preference.

In person, Mr. Campbell is below the middle stature, well made, but slender. His features indicate
great sensibility; his eyes are particularly striking, and of a deep blue colour; his nose
aquiline; his expression generally saturnine. His step is light, but firm; and he appears to
possess much more energy of constitution than men of fifty-two who have been studious in their
habits, exhibit in general. His time for study is mostly during the stillness of night, when
he can be wholly abstracted from external objects. He is remarkable for absence of mind; is
charitable and kind in his disposition, but of quick temper. His amusements are few; the friend
and conversation only; and in the "flow of soul" there are few men possessing more companionable
qualities. His heart is perhaps one of the best that beats in a human bosom: "it is," observes
a biographer, "that which should belong to the poet of Gertrude, his favourite personification."

To exhibit the poet in the social circle, as well as to introduce a very piquant portrait,
drawn by a friend, we subjoin a leaf or two from Leigh Hunt's Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries[5]--displaying
all the graphic ease for which Mr. Hunt is almost without a rival:--

    [5] We are aware of part of the subsequent extract having appeared
        in vol. xi. of THE MIRROR, but the additional interest which it
        bears in juxtaposition with this Memoir, induces us to repeat
        it here. Once or twice I saw
also Mr. Theodore Hook, and Mr. Matthews, the comedian. When he indulges in doubt
and sarcasm, and speaks contemptuously of things in general, he does it,
partly, no doubt, out of actual dissatisfaction, but more perhaps than
he suspects, out of a fear of being thought weak and sensitive--which is
a blind that the best men very commonly practise. Mr. Campbell professes
to be hopeless and sarcastic, and takes pains all the while to set up an
university. There is one
of our writers who has more fame than he; but not one who enjoys a
fame equally wide, and without drawback. Like many of the great men in
Germany, Schiller, Wieland, and others, he has not scrupled to become
editor of a magazine; and his name alone has given it among all circles
a recommendation of the greatest value, and such as makes it a grace to
write under him.

"I have since been unable to help wishing, perhaps not very wisely, that Mr. Campbell would
be a little less careful and fastidious in what he did for the public; for, after all, an author
may reasonably be supposed to do best that which he is most inclined to do. It is our business
to be grateful for what a poet sets before us, rather than to be wishing that his peaches were
nectarines, or his Falernian Champagne. Mr. Campbell, as an author, is all for refinement and
classicality, not, however, without a great deal of pathos and luxurious fancy."

Mr. Campbell's literary labours are perhaps too well known and estimated to require from us
any thing more than a rapid enumeration of the most popular, as supplementary to this brief
memoir. In his studies he exhibits great fondness for recondite subjects; and will frequently
spend days in minute investigations into languages, which, in the result, are of little moment.
But his ever-delightful theme is Greece, her arts, and literature. There he is at home: it
was his earliest, and will, probably, be his latest study. There is no branch of poetry or
history which has reached us from the "mother of arts" with which he is not familiar. He has
severely criticised Mitford for his singular praise of the Lacedaemonians at the expense of
the Athenians, and his preference of their barbarous laws to the legislation of the latter
people. His lectures on Greek Poetry have appeared, in parts, in the New Monthly Magazine.

Among his poetical works, the minor pieces display considerably more energy than those of greater
length. The Pleasures of Hope is entitled to rank as a British classic; and his Gertrude is
perhaps one of the most chaste and delicate poems in the language. His fugitive pieces are
more extensively known. Some of them rouse us like the notes of a war trumpet, and have become
exceedingly popular; which every one who has heard the deep rolling voice of Braham or Phillips
in Hohenlinden, will attest. Neither can we forget the beautiful Valedictory Stanzas to John
Kemble, at the farewell dinner to that illustrious actor. Another piece, the Last Man, is indeed
fine--and worthy of Byron. Of Campbell's attachment to his native country we have already spoken,
but as a finely-wrought specimen of this amiable passion we subjoin a brief poem:

LINES WRITTEN ON VISITING A SCENE IN ARGYLESHIRE.

  At the silence of twilight's contemplative hour,
    I have mused in a sorrowful mood,
  On the wind-shaken weeds that embosom the bower,
    Where the home of my forefathers stood.
  Like a brotherless hermit, the last of its race,
    All wild in the silence of nature, it drew,
  From each wandering sun-beam, a lonely embrace
  For the night-weed and thorn overshadow'd the place,
    Where the flower of my forefathers grew.

  Sweet bud of the wilderness! emblem of all
    That remains in this desolate heart!
  The fabric of bliss to its centre may fall,
    But patience shall never depart!

Of a similar description are his "Lines on revisiting a Scottish River."[6]

    [6] See MIRROR, No. 257.

Mr. Campbell contributes but little to the pages of the New Monthly Magazine: still, what he
writes is excellent, and as we uniformly transfer his pieces to the Mirror, we need not recapitulate
them. The fame of Campbell, however, rests on his early productions, which, though not numerous,
are so correct, and have been so fastidiously revised, that while they remain as standards
of purity in the English tongue, they sufficiently explain why their author's compositions
are so limited in number, "since he who wrote so correctly could not be expected to write much."
His Poetical pieces have lately been collected, and published in two elegant library volumes,
with a portrait esteemed as an extremely good likeness.

A contemporary critic, speaking of the superiority of Campbell's minor effusions, when compared
with his larger efforts, observes, "His genius, like the beautiful rays of light that illumine
our atmosphere, genial and delightful as they are when expanded, are yet without power in producing
any active or immediate effect. In their natural expansions they sparkle to be sure, and sweetly
shine; but it is only when condensed, and brought to bear upon a limited space or solitary
object, that they acquire the power to melt, to burn, or to communicate their fire to the object
they are in contact with." Another writer says, "In common with every lover of poetry, we regret
that his works are so few; though, when a man has written enough to achieve immortality, he
cannot be said to have trifled away his life. Mr. Campbell's poetry will find its way wherever
the English language shall be spoken, and will be admired wherever it is known."
